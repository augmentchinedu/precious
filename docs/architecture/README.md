# Augment Plus Architecture

This directory contains all project-level architectural documentation for the Augment Plus platform. As the Project Architect, my role is to ensure that our projects are designed in a robust, scalable, and maintainable manner, aligning with the strategic direction set by the Platform Architect.

## Purpose

The documents herein serve as the canonical source of truth for:
- The high-level design of our projects.
- The interaction between different services and components.
- The technological choices and the rationale behind them.
- The integration patterns with the core platform runtime.

All development work should be guided by the principles and specifications laid out in these documents.

## Projects

Detailed architectural documentation for each major project can be found in their respective files:

- **[The Great Unknown](./THE_GREAT_UNKNOWN.md):** Our primary integration project, focused on extending the platform's capabilities.
- **[AgriMart](./AGRIMART.md):** (Documentation pending)
- **[Augment Plus Platform](./PLATFORM.md):** (Documentation pending)

This structure will be expanded as our ecosystem evolves.
