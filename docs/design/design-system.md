## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the foundational design principles and tokens for the Augment Plus Graphical User Interface (GUI). The goal is to establish a consistent, professional, and accessible visual language across the entire application. All new components should adhere to these guidelines.

This system is based on the initial design implemented by Roni in `Home.vue`.
