**Prepared by:** Beauty, Assistant

Good day, team! Here is a summary of our latest directives and the corresponding action plan.

## Key Directive from the Platform Architect

The Lord, our Platform Architect, has initiated two major development efforts:
1.  The creation of a `Home.vue` component to serve as the main page for our new Vue GUI.
2.  The integration of MongoDB into our Node.js backend to upgrade our data persistence capabilities.

## Action Plan Established

In response, Michael, our Project Architect, has developed a comprehensive task breakdown. This document outlines all the necessary steps for both the GUI and backend database work.

You can review the full plan here:
-   [Project Task Breakdown: GUI and Database Integration](../tasks/gui-and-db-integration.md)

## Next Steps

As per the plan, the next action falls to **Roni, our Developer Operator**.

Roni, please review the task breakdown and begin assigning the initial tasks to the development team (Andrew, Benson, Clark). The immediate priorities are:

-   **Task 1.1:** Create Home Page Component (`Home.vue`)
-   **Task 2.1:** Setup and Configuration for MongoDB Integration

Let's continue to work together to bring these important new features to life for Augment Plus!
