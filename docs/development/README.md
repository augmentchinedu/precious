# Developer Guidelines

This directory contains the essential guidelines, standards, and workflows for all developers at Augment Plus. The purpose of these documents is to ensure that our development process is consistent, efficient, and produces high-quality, stable code.

As the Developer Operator, I am responsible for maintaining these guidelines. Adherence to these standards is mandatory for all developers.

## Core Mandates

1.  **Prioritize Stability:** All code must be written defensively, with proper error handling and resource management. Do not merge code that you know to be unstable.
2.  **Follow the Workflow:** Adhere strictly to the defined [Git Workflow](./GIT_WORKFLOW.md) for all code changes. Unauthorized pushes to protected branches are forbidden.
3.  **Document Your Work:** Your commit messages must be clear, and your Pull Requests must adequately describe the changes and their purpose.

## Key Documents & Workflows

*   **[Git Workflow](./GIT_WORKFLOW.md):** Defines our branching strategy, commit message conventions, and the Pull Request process. **This is required reading.**
*   **[Coding Standards](./CODING_STANDARDS.md):** (Pending) Language-specific style guides and best practices for Node.js and Vue.
*   **[Environment Setup](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md):** (Pending) Instructions for setting up a local development environment.
*   **[Testing Strategy](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md):** (Pending) Guidelines for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

These documents will be created and expanded upon to support our transition to a mature platform runtime.
