# Augment Plus Documentation Hub

Welcome to the central documentation hub for the Augment Plus platform. This repository contains all essential documentation for developers, architects, and designers working on the platform.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a single source of truth for our engineering efforts, ensuring clarity, consistency, and alignment with our strategic goals.

## Key Sections

Please refer to the following sections for detailed information:

*   **[Architecture](./architecture/README.md):** Contains high-level design documents, architectural principles, and project-specific blueprints. This section is essential for understanding the structural foundation of our projects.

*   **[Design](./design/README.md):** Contains design system guidelines, UI/UX principles, and style guides. All user-facing components should adhere to the standards outlined here.

*   **[Development](./development/README.md):** Contains coding standards, development workflows, backend/frontend guidelines, and setup instructions. This is the primary resource for all developers.

All team members are expected to familiarize themselves with the documents relevant to their role to ensure a cohesive and efficient workflow.
