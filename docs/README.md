# Augment Plus Documentation Hub

## 1. Overview

Welcome to the central documentation hub for Augment Plus and The Great Unknown ecosystem. This directory serves as the single source of truth for all project guidelines, architectural blueprints, and operational procedures.

The creation and unification of this documentation follows the directive from our Platform Architect, The Lord, to ensure all team members are aligned and have access to consistent, up-to-date information.

## 2. Key Documents

Please familiarize yourself with the following core documents. Each is maintained by the designated role-holder.

*   **[System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   **Maintained by:** Michael (Project Architect)
    *   **Purpose:** Outlines the high-level system architecture, including the service-oriented node structure, code modules, and deployment strategy on Google Cloud. This is the primary technical blueprint.

*   **[Developer Onboarding & Setup](./DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)**
    *   **Maintained by:** Michael (Project Architect)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides actionable steps for developers to set up their environment and, most importantly, verify their access to the core GitHub repositories.
