# Augment Plus Community Guidelines & Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and leaders pledge to make participation in our projects and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating a community where collaboration and learning can flourish, and where every individual feels respected and valued.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**
*   **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.**
*   **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.**
*   **Focusing on what is best for the community and our projects.**
*   **Showing empathy towards other community members.**
*   **Assuming good faith in all interactions.**

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.**
*   **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.**
*   **Public or private harassment.**
*   **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.**
*   **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.**

## 3. Our Responsibilities

As the Community Administrator, Sandra is responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. However, all community members share the responsibility of upholding these guidelines and helping to maintain a positive environment. Any member can and should report behavior that violates this code.

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Augment Plus spaces, including but not limited to:

*   GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions).
*   Official communication channels (e.g., Slack, Discord, if established).
*   Social media channels managed by Augment Plus.
*   Any other forum created by the project team.

It also applies to individuals representing Augment Plus in public spaces.

## 5. Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Community Administrator, Sandra, directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

The Community Administrator has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 6. Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness any violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it. You can report an incident by contacting the Community Administrator, **Sandra**, through a designated and confidential channel (to be established, e.g., `community-admin@augmentplus.com`). All reports will be handled with discretion and will be taken seriously.
