# Community Hub

This directory contains documents that define the standards, guidelines, and social contract for the Augment Plus community. As the Community Administrator, my role is to maintain these documents and ensure a healthy, collaborative, and respectful environment for all members.

Our community is our greatest asset. These guidelines exist to protect it and ensure that our interactions are as robust and well-structured as our code.

## Key Documents

*   **[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):** Defines the expectations for behavior for all members of the Augment Plus community. **All members must read and adhere to this.**
*   **[Onboarding Guide](./ONBOARDING.md):** (Pending) A step-by-step guide for new members joining the team.

Refer to the root-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` for specific guidelines on how to contribute to our projects.
