📢 **Platform Update: Custom Domain Mappings!**

Hello everyone,

We're thrilled to announce a significant upgrade to how you access The Great Unknown services! Our Platform Administration team has successfully implemented custom domain mappings for all our nodes.

**What this means for you:**
*   **Easier Access:** Our services are now available through more intuitive and memorable custom domains.
*   **Professional Presence:** A more streamlined and professional experience for both production and development environments.
*   **Production:** Access our main platform at `https://gkrane.online`, with specific services like games, stores, AI, and currency available at `games.gkrane.online`, `stores.gkrane.online`, `ai.gkrane.online`, and `currency.gkrane.online`.
*   **Development:** Developers can continue to access our development environment via `https://bawell.online` and its subdomains.

This enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to improving the platform's accessibility and user experience.

Kudos to the Platform Administration team for their excellent work!

Thank you for being part of our journey! 🚀
