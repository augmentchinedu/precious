# Augment Plus Project Charter

## 1.0 Introduction

This document serves as the master charter for all projects undertaken by Augment Plus. Its purpose is to establish a consistent framework for project initiation, execution, and governance. Adherence to this charter is mandatory to prevent structural regression and ensure alignment with the platform's strategic objectives as defined by the Platform Architect and Leadership.

## 2.0 Project Governance

- **Project Initiation:** All new projects must be approved by the Project Architect and align with the platform roadmap. Each project will have a dedicated Markdown file under the `/projects` directory.
- **Architectural Oversight:** The Project Architect (Michael) is responsible for the overall technical structure of all projects. Architectural decisions must be documented and reviewed.
- **Resource Allocation:** The Developer Operator (Roni) will manage developer assignments to projects based on the defined project plans and priorities.
- **Design Oversight:** The Design Manager (Sage) will oversee and ensure design consistency across all user-facing projects.

## 3.0 Core Projects

The platform's development efforts are organized into the following core projects:

- **The Great Unknown (TGU):** The primary integration target for the platform runtime. This project represents our connection to the broader ecosystem.
- **Platform GUI:** The primary human-computer interface for interacting with Augment Plus.
- **AgriMart:** A specific application project built on the Augment Plus platform.
- **Augment Plus Core:** The foundational services, APIs, and infrastructure of the platform itself.

## 4.0 Documentation Standard

Each project must maintain a dedicated `[PROJECT_NAME].md` file in the `/projects` directory, outlining:
- **Scope and Objectives:** What the project aims to achieve.
- **Key Personnel:** Roles and responsibilities (e.g., Lead Developer, Designer).
- **Technical Architecture:** High-level design, key components, and data flow.
- **Integration Points:** How the project interfaces with other systems or projects.
- **Status:** Current state of development (e.g., Planning, Active, Deprecated).
