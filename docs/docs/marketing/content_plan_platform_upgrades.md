**Author:** Francesca, Social Media Manager
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Reference:** `docs/project/dev_switch_plan.md`, `docs/design/client_gui_input_specs.md`

## 1. Objective

This document outlines a social media content strategy to communicate the ongoing platform enhancements (AI node refactor, migration to GAE/MongoDB, and client GUI improvements) to our external audience. The goal is to build excitement, showcase our technical expertise, and highlight the upcoming benefits for our users.

## 2. Core Messaging Themes

Our communication will be built around three key pillars:

1.  **Innovation and Scalability:** We are not just maintaining our platform; we are rebuilding its core to be faster, more robust, and ready for future growth. The move to Google App Engine and MongoDB is a testament to our forward-thinking approach.
2.  **Enhanced User Experience (UX):** We are actively listening to our users and improving our tools. The new client GUI components are a direct result of our commitment to providing a more powerful and intuitive interface.
3.  **The Power of Collaboration:** Great things are built by great teams. We will shine a light on the collaborative effort of our architects, developers, and designers, building trust and community.

## 3. Proposed Content Ideas & Channels

### 3.1. "Behind the Build" Series (Twitter/LinkedIn)

*   **Concept:** A series of posts that give a behind-the-scenes look at the development process.
*   **Post 1 (Announce):** "Big things are happening at Augment Plus! Our development team is currently re-architecting our core AI for a massive leap in performance and scalability. #TechUpgrade #GAE #MongoDB"
*   **Post 2 (Collaboration):** "From architecture to execution! Highlighting the incredible teamwork between our developers (Andrew, Benson, Clark) as they lay the groundwork for our next-gen AI. #SoftwareEngineering #Teamwork"
*   **Post 3 (Design):** "It's not just about what's under the hood. Our Design Manager, Sage, is crafting a more intuitive client experience. Sneak peek of the design principles guiding our new GUI. #UIDesign #UX"

### 3.2. Blog Post / Medium Article

*   **Title:** "Why We're Rebuilding Our Core: The Augment Plus Journey to a Cloud-Native Future."
*   **Content:** A long-form article authored conceptually by the Platform Architect or Project Architect. It will explain in accessible terms why we are migrating to GAE and MongoDB, focusing on the benefits of speed, reliability, and future-proofing the platform.

### 3.3. Visual Teaser (Instagram/LinkedIn)

*   **Concept:** A polished graphic or short animation based on the design specifications from `docs/design/client_gui_input_specs.md`.
*   **Caption:** "Get ready for more control. We're designing a more powerful and intuitive interface to help our clients bring their vision to life. Coming soon to Augment Plus. #UI #WebApp #PWA"

## 4. Timeline

*   **Phase 1 (Now):** Begin drafting the blog post and creating the visual assets for the "Behind the Build" series.
*   **Phase 2 (During Development):** Roll out the "Behind the Build" series on Twitter and LinkedIn to generate early buzz and showcase progress.
*   **Phase 3 (Pre-Launch):** Publish the blog post and the visual GUI teaser to build anticipation for the official release.

This proactive content strategy will ensure that when these powerful new features are launched, our community is already informed, engaged, and excited.
