# AI Project Content Style Guide

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the style and formatting standards for all Markdown content generated by agents within the `ai` project. The purpose of this guide is to ensure that our knowledge base is consistent, professional, readable, and machine-parsable.

Adherence to this guide is mandatory for all content contributed via `FILE_ACTION` blocks. This is a critical component of ensuring deterministic and high-quality output.

## 2. Document Structure

All `.md` files created by agents must follow this structure.

### 2.1. Title
Every document must begin with a single Level 1 Heading (`#`) as its title.

### 2.2. Sections and Subsections
- Use Level 2 Headings (`##`) for major sections.
- Use Level 3 Headings (`###`) for subsections.
- All headings must be numbered to create a clear hierarchy and allow for easy referencing (e.g., `## 1. Introduction`, `### 1.1. Purpose`).

## 3. Formatting and Tone

### 3.1. Professional Tone
Content must be objective, technical, and professional. Avoid emotional language, speculation, or conversational filler.

### 3.2. Markdown Usage
- **Emphasis**: Use `**bold**` to highlight key terms, concepts, or required actions.
- **Literals**: Use backticks (`` ` ``) for all literals, including file paths (`docs/projects/ai/README.md`), object keys (`agent.name`), code, and specific commands (`git revert`).
- **Lists**: Use unordered lists (`- `) for collections of items. Use ordered lists (`1. `) for sequential steps or procedures.
- **Internal Links**: All links to other documents within the project must be relative: `[DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)`.

## 4. Protocol Blocks

The `FILE_ACTION` and `DEBATE` protocols have their own strict formatting which must be reproduced exactly. The content *within* the `FILE_ACTION` block's Markdown section must adhere to the rules in this style guide.
