# AI Project Business Case

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the business justification for the `ai` project. It outlines the strategic vision, business goals, scope, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure the project's success. It serves as the primary reference for aligning technical development with the business objectives of Augment Plus.

## 2. Project Vision & Business Justification

**Vision:** To create an autonomous engineering agent system that serves as a force multiplier for all future development activities within Augment Plus.

**Justification:** The `ai` project is a strategic investment in our core capabilities. By perfecting this system first, we are building a platform asset that will allow us to develop future web projects with significantly greater speed, higher quality, and lower cost. The short-term focus on internal infrastructure is justified by the long-term competitive advantage this system will provide.

## 3. Business Goals

The `ai` project is considered "perfected" when it demonstrably achieves the following business goals:

1.  **Accelerate Development:** Drastically reduce the time from project conception to deployment for future web projects.
2.  **Enhance Quality:** Systematically improve the quality and reduce the defect rate of all generated code and documentation.
3.  **Increase Scalability:** Enable the organization to scale its development capacity without a linear increase in human personnel.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Progress towards the business goals will be measured by the following KPIs. These metrics must be tracked by the platform runtime.

### 4.1. Velocity & Throughput

- **Mean Time to Implement Feature:** The average time taken for the agent system to implement a well-defined feature request (once web projects begin).
- **Documentation Coverage Rate:** The percentage of project components (architectural, operational, code) that have corresponding, up-to-date documentation.

### 4.2. Quality & Stability

- **System Stability Index:** A composite score based on agent error rates, successful `FILE_ACTION`s, and adherence to operational procedures.
- **Code Defect Density:** Number of bugs per thousand lines of agent-generated code, to be measured in future projects.

### 4.3. Autonomy & Efficiency

- **Human Intervention Rate:** The frequency with which a human operator needs to correct, override, or manually guide the agent system. The primary goal is to drive this rate towards zero for defined tasks.
- **Context-to-Action Ratio:** The efficiency with which agents can convert context into meaningful, value-adding actions.

## 5. Scope

### 5.1. In-Scope

- Development and refinement of the core agent system and its supporting architecture.
- Creation and maintenance of all documentation related to the `ai` project.
- Implementation of monitoring, testing, and deployment systems for the agents.

### 5.2. Out-of-Scope (for now)

- Development of any external, client-facing web projects.
- Direct monetization of the agent system itself.
