# AI Project Documentation

## 1. Overview

This directory contains all official documentation for the `ai` project, which is focused on developing a system of autonomous engineering agents for Augment Plus.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a single source of truth for the project's architecture, standards, and operational procedures. This ensures all work is aligned with the platform's core principles of determinism and stability.

## 2. Document Index

This section serves as a master index for all key project documents.

### 2.1. Core Documents

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Outlines the foundational architectural principles, component models, and integration strategies for the `ai` project. This is the primary technical blueprint.
- **[DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md](./DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md)**: Defines the rules and structure for creating and maintaining documentation within the Augment Plus ecosystem.

### 2.2. Planned Documents

The following documents are planned to further structure our knowledge base:

- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`: Will provide practical guidance and standards for developers and agents contributing to the project.
- `DATA_MODELS.md`: Will define the schemas for data persistence in preparation for the MongoDB integration, as referenced in the architecture.
