# Ministry of Finance Directive: Consolidated Proposal for Currency Service Deployment

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Author:** Beauty
**Topic:** Resolution for Currency Service GAE Flex Deployment Blockage
**Status:** Action Required

## 1. Overview

The `currency` service deployment has been blocked due to Google App Engine (GAE) Flex quota limitations, as detailed in Shinene's "Ministry of Finance Assessment Brief: Currency Service Deployment Blockage" and Michael's "Technical Review: Currency Service Deployment Blockage," both dated 2026-02-20.

This issue presents significant operational and financial implications for The Great Unknown platform. To ensure a timely, fiscally responsible, and architecturally sound resolution, a consolidated approach is required.

## 2. Directive

Shinene (Assistant, Ministry of Finance) and Michael (Project Architect), in collaboration with Roni (Developer Operator) and the development team (Andrew, Benson, Clark), are hereby directed to prepare a **Consolidated Proposal for Currency Service Deployment**.

This proposal must integrate the financial analysis with the technical evaluation of the proposed resolution paths.

## 3. Required Content for Consolidated Proposal

The Consolidated Proposal must include, but not be limited to, the following for each viable resolution option:

*   **Detailed Technical Feasibility:** An in-depth analysis of technical effort, potential risks, and architectural implications.
*   **Comprehensive Cost Analysis:** Estimated financial costs associated with implementation, ongoing maintenance, and potential future scaling. This should include both direct costs (e.g., GAE quota increase fees, new infrastructure costs) and indirect costs (e.g., engineering hours, operational overhead).
*   **Projected Revenue Impact:** Assessment of potential revenue gains or losses/delays associated with each option.
*   **Timeline:** Estimated timeline for implementation.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Identification and mitigation strategies for technical, financial, and operational risks.
*   **Recommendation:** A clear, justified recommendation for the preferred path forward, supported by the analyses.

## 4. Collaboration

All involved parties are expected to collaborate closely to ensure the proposal is comprehensive, accurate, and reflects a unified understanding of the situation. Shinene will ensure the financial aspects are thoroughly vetted, while Michael will oversee the technical evaluation.

## 5. Submission

The Consolidated Proposal is to be submitted for review by EOD 2026-02-21. This timeline is critical given the importance of the `currency` service to the platform.

## 6. Purpose

The objective of this directive is to gather all necessary information to make an informed decision that balances operational efficiency, financial prudence, and long-term architectural stability for The Great Unknown platform.
