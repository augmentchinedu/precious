# Finance Ministry Directive: Cloud Billing Funding and Assistant Transition

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Author:** Shinene (Assistant, Finance Ministry)
**Status:** Draft - Awaiting Finance Minister Approval

## 1. Executive Summary

This directive outlines crucial updates regarding the platform's financial protocols, specifically the funding mechanism for cloud billing accounts and a significant personnel transition within the Finance Ministry. These changes are in direct response to the recent platform advancements detailed by the Platform Architect.

## 2. Personnel Transition: Assistant to the Finance Minister

*   **Soteria's Appointment:** Effective immediately, Soteria assumes the role of Assistant to the Finance Minister, replacing the former Assistant, Beauty. All internal systems, communication channels, and access permissions must be updated to reflect this change.
*   **Onboarding and Responsibilities:** The Finance Minister will facilitate Soteria's comprehensive onboarding, ensuring a seamless transition of responsibilities, particularly concerning the oversight of financial quotas and billing.

## 3. Cloud Billing Account Funding Policy

*   **New Funding Source:** Cloud billing accounts for all platform operations (development and production environments on Google Cloud Platform, including Cloud Run and CDN services) will henceforth be funded exclusively from the **revenue generated by our stores and games**.
*   **Direct Revenue Linkage:** This policy establishes a direct and transparent linkage between operational infrastructure costs and the primary revenue-generating activities of the platform.
*   **Implications for Financial Oversight:**
    *   **Revenue Tracking:** The Finance Ministry, in collaboration with the Stores and Games nodes, must implement robust mechanisms for accurate and timely tracking of revenue streams.
    *   **Budget Allocation:** Budgets for cloud services must be directly allocated from and contingent upon the performance of the stores and games. This requires proactive forecasting and reconciliation.
    *   **Cost Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of GCP costs (compute, storage, network, CDN, etc.) is paramount to ensure alignment with revenue generation and to identify potential cost optimizations.
    *   **Quotas:** The concept of "quotas for our currency" when funding the cloud billing account implies a controlled allocation based on available revenue. This requires a precise method for calculating and transferring funds.

## 4. Operational Requirements for Finance Ministry

*   **Financial Reporting Adjustment:** All financial reports and forecasts related to cloud expenditure must now clearly delineate the funding source as revenue from stores and games.
*   **Inter-Ministry Collaboration:** Close collaboration with the teams managing the 'stores' and 'games' nodes will be essential to understand revenue projections, financial performance, and any factors that may impact the ability to fund cloud services.
*   **Review Mechanism:** A regular review mechanism will be established to assess the effectiveness of this funding model and make any necessary adjustments to ensure platform stability and financial health.

## 5. Conclusion

This directive ensures that the financial management of our cloud infrastructure is directly tied to the platform's core business success. The Finance Ministry is committed to diligently implementing this policy to support the platform's growth and sustainability.
