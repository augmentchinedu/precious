## 6. Maintaining "Living Documents"

*   **Regular Updates:** Review and update documents periodically to ensure their continued relevance and accuracy. The "Date" and "Status" fields should always reflect the latest information.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Encourage feedback from stakeholders to improve documentation quality.
*   **Archiving:** Deprecated or outdated documents should be clearly marked as "Archived" and potentially moved to an archive sub-directory, rather than deleted, to preserve historical context.
