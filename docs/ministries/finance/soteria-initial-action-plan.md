**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Author:** Soteria (Assistant, Finance Ministry)
**Status:** Draft - Submitted for Review by Finance Minister and Shinene

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines my initial action plan and operational understanding as the newly appointed Assistant within the Finance Ministry. This plan is developed in response to the Platform Architect's update and builds upon the directives issued, particularly concerning the cloud billing funding model.

## 2. Acknowledgment of Role and Directives

I acknowledge my appointment as Assistant to the Finance Minister, replacing Beauty, as stated in the `Finance Ministry Directive: Cloud Billing Funding and Assistant Transition` (docs/ministries/finance/directives/2026-02-21-cloud-billing-funding-directive.md). I have reviewed this directive and understand its implications for cloud billing funding and my responsibilities.

## 3. Operational Plan for Cloud Billing Funding Oversight

My primary focus will be to support the Finance Ministry in implementing and overseeing the new policy that mandates cloud billing accounts be funded exclusively from the revenue generated by our stores and games. My operational steps include:

### 3.1. Familiarization and System Access
*   Gain comprehensive understanding of current cloud billing expenditure, forecasting models, and existing financial reporting systems.
*   Ensure full access to relevant Google Cloud Platform billing accounts and reporting dashboards for continuous monitoring.

### 3.2. Revenue Stream Integration
*   Collaborate with the teams managing the "stores" and "games" nodes to establish direct data feeds or regular reporting mechanisms for revenue generation.
*   Work with Shinene to reconcile revenue data against cloud expenditure to ensure compliance with the new funding policy.

### 3.3. Quota Management and Allocation Support
*   Assist in defining the methodology and parameters for establishing "quotas for our currency" for cloud services, aligning with anticipated revenue from stores and games.
*   Support the Finance Minister in allocating these quotas to development and production GCP projects, including Cloud Run and CDN services.

### 3.4. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting
*   Establish and maintain dashboards for real-time monitoring of cloud spend versus revenue performance.
*   Prepare regular reports for the Finance Minister detailing compliance with the funding directive, identifying any discrepancies, and proposing corrective actions.
*   Flag potential financial risks related to cloud expenditure exceeding revenue projections from the designated sources.

### 3.5. Stakeholder Coordination
*   Maintain open communication channels with the Platform Administrator (Sandra) for infrastructure changes impacting billing, and the Platform Architect (The Lord) for strategic infrastructure decisions.
*   Liaise with developer teams through the Augment Plus Project Architect (Michael) to understand resource consumption patterns.

## 4. Onboarding and Collaboration

I will actively engage in the comprehensive onboarding process facilitated by the Finance Minister and collaborate closely with Shinene to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities and effective execution of financial oversight.

## 5. Conclusion

This plan serves as my commitment to diligently support the Finance Ministry in managing the platform's financial health, particularly in adapting to the new cloud billing funding model and ensuring optimal resource allocation.
