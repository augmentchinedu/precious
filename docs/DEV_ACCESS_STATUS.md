# Developer Access Verification Status

## 1. Mandate

This document tracks the completion of the developer access verification task, as mandated by the Platform Architect and detailed in the [Developer Onboarding & Setup](./DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) guide.

The objective is to ensure all members of the development team have `git clone` access to all required code repositories.

## 2. Team & Repositories

-   **Team:** Roni (Developer Operator), Andrew (Developer), Benson (Developer), Clark (Developer).
-   **Repositories:** `node`, `models`, `schemas`, `components`.

## 3. Access Status Checklist

Each developer must follow the instructions in the setup guide and confirm their ability to clone each repository. This table will be updated as confirmations are received.
