# Project Plan: Vue GUI Development

**Author:** Michael, Project Architect
**Date:** 2026-02-17

## 1. Objective
To build a modern, responsive, and user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Augment Plus platform using Vue 3. This GUI will serve as the primary interaction point for our users.

## 2. Key Request
As per the directive from The Lord, the Platform Architect, the immediate priority is the creation of the main home page component.

## 3. Phase 1: Foundation

### Task: 3.1: Create Home.vue Component
- **Description:** Create the initial `Home.vue` single-file component. This will serve as the landing page and the central view of the application.
- **Details:** The initial version can be a simple placeholder with a header, a main content area, and a footer. It should be structured to be easily expandable.
- **Assigned:** Roni to delegate (Recommendation: Andrew).
- **Status:** To Do

### Task 3.2: Basic Routing
- **Description:** Implement `vue-router` to handle navigation. The initial setup should have a single route pointing to the `Home` component.
- **Details:** This ensures our application is scalable for future pages and views.
- **Assigned:** TBD
- **Status:** To Do

## 4. Future Phases
- **Component Library:** Evaluate and integrate a component library like Vuetify or PrimeVue.
- **State Management:** Implement Pinia for centralized state management.
- **PWA Features:** Enhance the application with Progressive Web App capabilities.
