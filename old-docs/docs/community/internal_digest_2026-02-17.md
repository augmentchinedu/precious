Hello Augment Plus Team,

There's a lot of fantastic work happening as we begin a major platform upgrade initiative, following the recent directive from our Platform Architect, The Lord. To keep everyone in the loop, here is a summary of the key plans and documents that have been produced.

The core of this initiative is the creation of manual development switches to allow parallel work on a new client GUI and a significant refactor of our `/ai` node, preparing us for migration to MongoDB and Google App Engine.

### Key Documents & Progress:

The team has moved quickly to structure this effort. Please take a moment to review these new documents:

*   **Project Plan (`docs/project/dev_switch_plan.md`):** Michael, our Project Architect, has laid out the high-level plan, breaking down the tasks for the GUI and AI node workstreams.
*   **Task Summary (`docs/tasks/dev_switch_task_summary.md`):** Beauty has created a concise summary of immediate responsibilities for each team member involved. A great quick-reference guide!
*   **Developer Guide (`docs/development/manual_switch_guide.md`):** Roni has proactively documented the new `DEV_SWITCH` protocol and the process for using the `/dev` directory. **All developers should read this.**
*   **AI Node Reviews (`docs/ai/review_andrew.md` & `docs/ai/review_benson.md`):** Andrew and Benson have conducted thorough initial reviews of the `/ai` node, analyzing the data persistence and agent execution models. Their insights are shaping the refactoring strategy.
*   **AI Dev Switch (`/dev/ai/index.js`):** Building on the reviews, Clark has already proposed the main entry point for the new AI node, demonstrating fantastic momentum.
*   **GUI Design Specs (`docs/design/client_gui_input_specs.md`):** Sage has provided detailed design specifications for the new client input components, ensuring the front-end will be as polished as the back-end is powerful.
*   **Content Plan (`docs/marketing/content_plan_platform_upgrades.md`):** Francesca is already planning how we'll share this story of innovation with our external community, translating our technical wins into exciting narratives.

This is a brilliant example of cross-functional collaboration. Let's keep this energy going! Please familiarize yourselves with these documents and continue to support each other as we push Augment Plus forward.

Best,
