# Augment Plus Social Media Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the social media and content strategy for Augment Plus. Its purpose is to define a clear, consistent, and compelling brand voice that accurately reflects our technical excellence, design-forward thinking, and visionary leadership. This strategy is maintained by Francesca (Social Media Manager).

## 2. Core Messaging & Brand Voice

Our voice is the intersection of our leadership's personas: visionary, inspiring, and technically grounded. We are knowledgeable but not arrogant; professional but not corporate.

*   **Voice:** Authoritative, Passionate, Human-Centric, and Forward-Looking.
*   **Tone:** We adapt our tone to the platform, but it will always be encouraging, educational, and respectful.
*   **Core Message:** "Augment Plus is building the future of web development through a commitment to quality, community, and a unified vision."

## 3. Content Pillars

Our content will be organized around three core pillars to ensure a balanced and engaging feed.

### Pillar 1: Showcase Our Expertise (The "What")
This pillar demonstrates our capabilities and the quality of our work.
*   **Content Ideas:**
    *   Sharing insights from our `coding_standards.md` or `testing_strategy.md` (e.g., "Why we use Vitest for component testing at Augment Plus").
    *   Highlighting our tech stack (Vue 3, Node.js) and why we chose it.
    *   Teasing non-sensitive UI elements based on Sage's `design_system_principles.md`.
    *   Sharing links to our public GitHub repos and explaining the purpose of our projects (AgriMart, The Great Unknown).

### Pillar 2: The Augment Plus Culture (The "How")
This pillar provides a behind-the-scenes look at how we work, building transparency and trust.
*   **Content Ideas:**
    *   Posts about our "Stability First" principle from the `developer_operations_handbook.md`.
    *   Celebrating our structured workflow ("From GitHub Issue to 'Done': How we keep development organized").
    *   A series on our design philosophy: "Clarity Above All," "Accessible by Default."
    *   Spotlighting the different roles (agent personas) and their contributions to the ecosystem.

### Pillar 3: Vision & Community (The "Why")
This pillar connects with our audience on a higher level, sharing our mission and engaging with the broader dev community.
*   **Content Ideas:**
    *   Posts articulating the founder's vision for Augment Plus and its projects.
    *   Engaging in discussions about the future of web development, PWAs, and AI agents.
    *   Asking questions to the community (e.g., "What's your favorite feature in Vue 3's Composition API?").
    *   Sharing valuable articles, tools, and resources from the wider community.

## 4. Platform Strategy

*   **Twitter/X:** For real-time updates, developer community engagement, sharing quick tips, and participating in conversations.
*   **LinkedIn:** For professional articles, company milestones, and sharing long-form content about our culture and vision.
*   **GitHub:** As a living portfolio. We will ensure our repository READMEs are clean, informative, and welcoming.
*   **(Future) Blog:** A dedicated space for long-form articles based on our content pillars (e.g., deep-dives into our architecture, design system, or project journeys).

## 5. Initial Campaign: "Building with Principle"

To launch our new strategy, I propose a content series titled "Building with Principle." Over several weeks, we will publish a series of posts, each dedicated to one of the foundational documents recently created, explaining why it matters and how it contributes to the quality of our products. This will immediately establish our brand as serious, professional, and transparent.
