# Execution Layer Technical Specification

## 1. Purpose

This document provides the detailed technical specification for the **Execution Layer** of the AI Core System. It is a direct extension of the high-level architecture defined in the `docs/projects/ai/README.md` by Michael. The primary goal is to define the interface, behavior, and operational constraints necessary to ensure a stable, secure, and auditable read/write layer.

All agent interactions with the file system and version control system **must** be processed through this layer.

## 2. Operational Principles

-   **Security:** The layer must prevent unauthorized or malicious file system access. All actions must be authenticated and authorized.
-   **Atomicity:** Operations, especially those involving both file modification and version control, should be treated as atomic where possible. A failed operation should result in a clean rollback.
-   **Auditability:** Every action taken by the Execution Layer must be logged in a structured, non-repudiable format. This is critical for traceability and debugging.
-   **Idempotency:** Re-submitting an identical, successful action should not result in a changed state or an error.

## 3. API Specification

The Execution Layer's primary input is the `FILE_ACTION` block generated by an agent.

### 3.1. Input: `FILE_ACTION` Block

The layer will parse and validate the standard `FILE_ACTION` block.
