# Augment Plus: Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and leaders of Augment Plus, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.
*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Enforcement Responsibilities

The Community Administrator, Sandra, is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 5. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all official Augment Plus community spaces (e.g., Discord, forums, social media channels) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## 6. Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Community Administrator, **Sandra**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and the confidentiality of the reporter will be respected.

## 7. Enforcement Guidelines

Upon review of a reported violation, the following actions may be taken:

1.  **Correction**: A private, written warning from the Community Administrator, providing clarity on the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2.  **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3.  **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any or all community platforms.
4.  **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from the community.
