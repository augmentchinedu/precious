# Augment Plus Community Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Augment Plus community! We are a collective of developers, designers, and architects dedicated to building a robust and innovative web ecosystem. These guidelines are here to help you understand how we can best collaborate.

## Code of Conduct

All community members are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of background or identity.

## Communication Channels

To foster a culture of deep work and focused collaboration, we are consciously opting for asynchronous communication channels over real-time chat platforms like Discord.

Our primary hub for all community interaction is **GitHub**.

*   **GitHub Discussions:** For general questions, sharing ideas, show-and-tell, and community-wide conversations. This is our main "town square."
*   **GitHub Issues:** For reporting specific bugs, tracking feature requests, and discussing technical implementation details related to our modules. Please use the appropriate repository for your issue.

## Getting Help

*   **Technical Support:** If you have a technical question or have found a bug, please open an issue in the relevant repository.
*   **Administrative Support:** For questions about community governance, moderation, or these guidelines, please contact **Sandra**, the Community Administrator.

## A Living Document

These guidelines may be updated over time to meet the evolving needs of our community. We welcome constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement via GitHub Discussions.
