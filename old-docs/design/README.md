# Design Guidelines

Welcome to the design documentation for Augment Plus. This section provides the principles, standards, and assets necessary to create a cohesive, intuitive, and accessible user experience across all our products.

As the Design Manager, I am responsible for curating and maintaining this design system. All user-facing work must align with the guidelines defined here to ensure consistency and quality.

## Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to:
- Establish a shared understanding of our design philosophy.
- Provide a practical style guide for developers to implement designs accurately.
- Document our component library for efficient reuse.
- Ensure our products are accessible to all users.
